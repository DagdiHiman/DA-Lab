4. Write a R script for performing simple Linear Regression over advertisement dataset to predict
sales based on the past history of sales and budget spent for advertisement. Advertisement data
has to be stored in csv file and accessed with fields (Budget, sales).
```
Do the predictions :
a. Using predefined functions.
b. Without using predefined functions
```

5. Write a R script for Multiple linear regression analysis over advertisement dataset to predict sales
based on the past history of advertisement data with different medias, budget-spent-for-
advertisement and sales units (media,budget,sales).
```
Do the predictions :
a. Using predefined functions.
b. Without using predefined functions
```

6. Write a R script for KNN algorithm implementation for loan defaulters classification without
using predefined functions. Compare your results with predefined functions. Consider K=1 and
do the classification. Then you have to classify for k=2, K=3. Loan-defaulters.csv file has the
following fields : age,loan,defaulter-status.

7. Write a R script for performing simple linear regression over faculty dataset to predict their
publications based on their past performance in terms of number of publications and experience
in years. Faculty.csv file should have following field : ( no-of-publications,experience-in-yrs).
```
Do the predictions :
c. Using predefined functions.
d. Without using predefined functions
```

8. Write a R script to perform logistic regression over Bank data set with the fields ( qualification,
credit card, bank balance, default details).
```
Do the predictions of defaulter:
a. Using predefined functions.
b. Without using predefined functions
```

9. Write a R script to Demonstrate Linear Discriminate Analysis & QDA over Bank data set with
(qualification, credit card, bank balance, default details), using predefined functions.
```
Do the predictions of defaulter:
a. Using predefined functions.
```

10. Write a R script for visualizing the following.
```
a. Consider students marks scored in Physics,Chemistry,Maths,FOC,CAD. Draw the pie
chart for the same.
b. Consider different party candidates’ votes received from public in election. Show the
votes received in percentage in pie chart.
c. Consider the students’ performance in different subjects. (Like student roll.no, their
marks, gender). Show the pie chart for girls and boys students’ performance.
```

11. Write a R script for visualizing the following.
```
a. Consider students marks scored in Physics,Chemistry,Maths,FOC,CAD. Draw the bar
chart for the same.
b. Consider different party candidates’ votes received from public in election. Show the
votes received in percentage in bar chart.
c. Consider the students’ performance in different subjects. (Like student roll.no, their
marks, gender). Show the bar chart for girls and boys students’ performance.
```

12. Write a R script for visualizing the following.
```
a. Consider students marks scored in (Physics,Chemistry,Maths,FOC,CAD). Draw the
box plot for the same.
b. Consider different party candidates’ votes received from public in election. Show the
votes received in percentage in box plot.
c. Consider the students’ performance in different subjects. (Like student roll.no, their
marks, gender). Show the box plot for girls and boys students’ performance.
